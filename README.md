=======================================

I'm a researcher and an academic teacher at the Institute of Computer
and Information Sciences of the Czestochowa University of Technology,
Poland.  I'm interested in optical networks, specifically the
fixed-mobile integration and the elastic optical networks.  I have a
PhD in computer science from the Polish Academy of Sciences for my
work on performance evaluation of optical packet-switched networks.  I
have worked at various laboratories and companies in the USA, and have
got several awards, most notably the Polish National Science Center
fellowship and the Fulbright fellowship.  But most of all, I'm a
programmer.
