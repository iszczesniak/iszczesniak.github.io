I'm a researcher and an academic teacher at the Department of Computer
Science of the Częstochowa University of Technology, Poland.  I'm
interested in C++ programming, graph algorithms, and optical networks.
I have a PhD in computer science from the Polish Academy of Sciences
for my work on performance evaluation of optical packet-switched
networks.  I have worked at various laboratories and companies in the
USA, and have got several awards, most notably the Polish National
Science Center fellowship and the Fulbright fellowship.  I'm the lead
author of the [Generic Dijkstra for optical
networks](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.11.000568), which was
recognized for its excellence with the Editors' Pick.  But most of
all, I'm a programmer.
